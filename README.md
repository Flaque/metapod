## Learning about ActivityPub

### Basic Description

ActivityPub gives every user (or `actor` in it's vocab) on a server an "inbox" and an "outbox". But these are really just endpoints:

```
https://myactpub.site/activity/user/flaque/inbox
https://myactpub.site/activity/user/flaque/outbox
```

ActivityPub asks that you accept `GET` and `POST` requests to these endpoints where a `POST` tells a the server to put that in a user's queue or feed and `GET` lets the user retrieve info from the feed. 

You send messages called `ActivityStreams` that are really just a special spec of JSON:

```
{"@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
 "type": "Create",
 "id": "https://social.example/alyssa/posts/a29a6843-9feb-4c74-a7f7-081b9c9201d3",
 "to": ["https://chatty.example/ben/"],

            "attributedTo": "https://social.example/alyssa/",
            "to": ["https://chatty.example/ben/"],
            "content": "Say, did you finish reading that book I lent you?"}
```
